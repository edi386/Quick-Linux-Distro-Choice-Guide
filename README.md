# Quick-Linux-Distro-Choice-Guide
Yeah, that's what the name just said :)

And, I'm going to be honest on this one. My personal experience will be involved in this one, so bear with me.

## What is even a distro?

Collection of components, from the kernel, to packages and the package management system. But each distro has different flavors and quirks that make them stand out from each other.

## Short but general recommendations

For the general audience, even those including non-tech savvy ones, and "I don't really have a preference, please throw one at me that you'd recommend!", stable, secure and mainstream distros such as Debian or OpenSUSE will literally be decent for the majority, especially when these distros offer top-tier desktop environments, such as KDE Plasma or Cinnamon.

And as for the user experience, if you genuinely care about *usability and productivity*, stick to using established desktop environments and reliable systems. Command-line is cool and brings skills & knowledge, but be honest with yourself, the most you'll do with them is file manipulation, git, remote connection, making user/system-wide changes, troubleshooting, basic Linux-fu, coding and god forbid anyone forgets, **Neofetch**, and so on. If you are focused on work but at same time loving to do casual stuff, you'll genuinely want to do the least tinkering possible; spending a significant amount of time tinkering with system and lots of app configurations & trying to get every thing right isn't exactly productive and you will inevitably break things in the way if you're not careful, leading to even worser outcomes, possibly going into "I have to reinstall that..." zone. You strive for a stable and reliable Linux distro instead, where you don't have to worry too much and can freely do anything within the reasonable framework without things breaking. You'll also want an experience that doesn't increase your temperature and frustration.

So, here it goes:

Distros for the general public -> **Debian, Linux Mint, Zorin, OpenSUSE**

Desktop environment for the general public -> **KDE Plasma, Budgie, Cinnamon, Gnome**

My personal "to avoid" for that recommendation:
- Older/average desktop environments such as LXDE: Not really worth it and not as well maintained & polished as others.
- Distros that **explicitly require** you to do CLI installation or lack the GUI means: That even includes Arch Linux, Gentoo, ... While installation scripts are a thing, for best results, people should stick to GUI installation whenever possible.
- Advanced distros that a seasoned/veteran Linux user will do: Related to earlier point.
- Window managers such as i3wm, Sway, Herbstluftwm, ...: You should be comfortable in Linux and system tinkering to do so. For beginners, don't.

## But you didn't mention the X factor/thing/issue

Of which I am aware, however.

The reality is, people need to use and work in an environment first before developing own preferences and attention to certain things. Someone who has first time in Linux can't just take a full dive in waters of Arch Linux and Gentoo; for they have to use and learn first, then from that point, passing the basics, they will have developed their preferences and skill sets that will decide what kind of system and environment they would like to have.

## What about seasoned users?

From that point, people with serious experience and preferences (myself included) know what they want, so my recommendations will have a little to no impact on their decision-making process.

But if one must, then Arch Linux is pretty much one of the best go-to for many who have passed the basics of Linux. Hell, you could just go to https://distrowatch.com/ and see whatever distros there are to read and pick. Arch Linux works pretty well already, in spite of the flaws surrounding it. Can be used for many things, beyond browsing and office stuff. Decent on laptops too.

## Okay but how do I try out those GNU/Linux distros?

A simple and fast way on diverse platforms would be to use Oracle's VirtualBox, which is open-source. It works, suited for and can do many things. Describing how to use VirtualBox is beyond the scope of this guide, because we are... talking about Linux distros, not about the installation procedure.

I hope this guide helps!
